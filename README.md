# Python_UFC_Analysis
The UFC Fight Data project on Kaggle covers every UFC fight from 1993-2020, with details on fighters, fight outcomes, and statistics. Originally with 144 columns, it was condensed to 41 for marketing and insights.
# Objective
For my own project, I'll analyze the UFC Dataset to conduct an initial exploration and derive insights. This will inform strategies for public fan engagement, marketing, and potential sales initiatives based on the findings.
# Data
I've sourced the dataset from Kaggle, which included raw data and additional datasets and folders as follows:
Json Maps Folder: Contains files for world and USA states.
Original Data Folder: Contains the raw data file.
Prepared Data Folder: Contains a CSV file which is the prepared datasets.
Project Management: Contains the project brief.
Scripts: Contains all Python scripts used for the analysis.
You can find my tableau story board here. https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/pratham.goswami/viz/UFCAnalysis6_7DataDashboard/Story1

(Note: The "Data" folder with original and prepared dataframes is not included due to file size constraints.)
